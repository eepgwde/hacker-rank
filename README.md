# Idiomatic Scala HackerRank Solutions for Scala

[HackerRank](https://hackerrank.com) is a site for programmers looking for work that want to show their ability.

I discovered [Hacker-Rank Solutions](https://github.com/rshaghoulian/HackerRank_solutions) for Java while I was working through the HackerRank problems. 
Some of the solutions to the Scala problems that I present are based on the Java solutions for the cases where I discovered that idiomatic Scala solutions were not fast enough to pass the tests.
